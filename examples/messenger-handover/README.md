# Messenger Handover

## Install and Run

Download this example or clone [bottender](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender).

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 bottender-master/examples/messenger-handover
cd messenger-handover
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

You must fill `MESSENGER_APP_ID`, `MESSENGER_APP_SECRET`, `MESSENGER_PAGE_ID`, `MESSENGER_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `MESSENGER_VERIFY_TOKEN` in your `.env` file.

If you are not familiar with Messenger Bot, you may refer to Bottender's doc, [Messenger Setup](https://bottender.js.org/docs/channel-messenger-setup), to find detailed instructions.

To make this example works, you may found that we enabled a few necessary `Page Subscriptions Fields` in `bottender.config.js`, e.g., `message_echoes`, `standby`, and `messaging_handovers`.

`Messenger Subscriptions` take effect when you run the below `Set Webhook` script.

After that, you can run the bot with this npm script:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command starts server for bot developing at `http://localhost:5000`.

If you successfully start the server, you can get a webhook URL like `https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io/webhooks/messenger` from command line.

## Set Webhook

While the server is running, you can run the following command with `bottender` to set up the webhook with the webhook URL you got from running `npm run dev`:

```sh
npx bottender messenger webhook set
```

> **Note:** You must fill in your `.env` file before running this command.
