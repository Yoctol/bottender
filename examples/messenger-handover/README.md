# Messenger Handover

## Install

Download this example or clone [bottender](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender).

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 bottender-master/examples/messenger-handover
cd messenger-handover
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Fill in Environment Variables

First, you have to put `appId`, `appSecret`, `pageId`, `accessToken` and `verifyToken` into `bottender.config.js`.

If you are not familiar with Messenger Bot, you may refer to Bottender's doc, [Setup Messenger](https://bottender.js.org/docs/channel-messenger-setup) to find detailed instructions.

To make this example works, you may also found that we enabled a few necessary `Messenger Subscriptions` in `bottender.js.config`, e.g., `message_echoes`, `standby`, and `messaging_handovers`.

`Messenger Subscriptions` take effect when you run the below `Set Webhook` script.

## Run

After that, you can run the bot with this npm script:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command starts server for bot developing at `http://localhost:5000`.

If you successfully start the server, you can get a webhook URL like `https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io/webhooks/messenger` from command line.

## Set Webhook

While the server running, you can run following command with `bottender` to set up the webhook with the webhook URL you get from running `npm run dev`:

```sh
npx bottender messenger webhook set -w <YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>
```

> Note: You must put `appId`, `appSecret`, `pageId`, `accessToken` and `verifyToken` into `bottender.config.js` before running this command.
