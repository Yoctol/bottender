## Idea of this example

This example shows the basic idea of building a cross-platform bot. You have
better understand the concept of
[handler](https://bottender.js.org/docs/APIReference-Handler) at first. The best
feature of this example is that you can only develop one handler for four
different bots, instead of developing one handler for each platform.
