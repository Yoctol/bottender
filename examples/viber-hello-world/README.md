## Install and Run

Download this example or clone [bottender](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender).

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 bottender-master/examples/viber-hello-world
cd viber-hello-world
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

You must put `accessToken` into `bottender.config.js`.

After that, you can run the bot with this npm script:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will start server for bot developing at `http://localhost:5000`.

If you successfully start the server, you will get a webhook url like `https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io/webhooks/viber` from command line.

## Set webhook

While the server running, you can run following command with `bottender` to set up the webhook with the webhook url you get from running `npm run dev`:

```sh
npx bottender viber webhook set -w <YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>
```

> Note: You must put `accessToken` into `bottender.config.js` before running this command.
