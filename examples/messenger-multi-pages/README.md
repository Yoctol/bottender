## Idea of this example

This example is a simple bot running on [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/) to reply separately by different page.\
You have to get at least two sets of `PAGE_ID` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` before running this bot. And you also need `APP_SECRET` of your app.\
For more information, check our [Messenger guides](https://bottender.js.org/docs/Platforms-Messenger).
