This command will start server for bot developing at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Idea of this example

This example shows how to send [messages with interactive components (button/menu)](https://api.slack.com/interactive-messages) and handle the event triggered by users clicking the button/menu.

For more information, check our [Slack guides](https://bottender.js.org/docs/Platforms-Slack).

## Usage

To receive interactive message requests, you need to setup **Interactive Components** in your Slack app with the same URL as **Event Subscriptions** URL.

After that, type 'heyo' to the bot and it will respond you with buttons and menu. Then click them to see what happens!
