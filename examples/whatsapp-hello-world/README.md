```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 bottender-master/examples/whatsapp-hello-world
cd whatsapp-hello-world
```

Install dependencies:

You must put `accountSid` and `authToken` into `bottender.config.js`.

After that, you can run the bot with this npm script:

```sh
npm run dev

This command will start server for bot developing at `http://localhost:5000`.

If you successfully start the server, you will get a webhook URL like `https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io/webhooks/whatsapp` from command line.
