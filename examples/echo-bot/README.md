## Idea of this example

This is a simple console bot which will echo what you said and shows how to
distinguish what kind of message the bot has received. The easiest way is to use
`context.event.isXXXXX`. It helps your bot recognize incoming requests.\
Check our [event guide](https://bottender.js.org/docs/APIReference-Event/) for more
