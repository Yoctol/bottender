Compose handlers.
Sometimes you may want to use multiple handlers to handle one event so you can reuse each of them on different situation. We provide `middleware` method which enables you to compose multiple handlers in a functional style.

> Middleware are simple functions which return a MiddlewareFunction with signature (ctx, next). When the middleware is run, it must manually invoke next() to run the "downstream" middleware.

## API

### middleware([handler1, handler2, ...])

Compose the given handlers as a middleware and return a composed handler.

Handlers is an array of functions with args like below:

```js
/**
 * @param {Object} context - A context can use all methods in client (see {@link
 *     https://github.com/bottenderjs/messaging-apis}|messaging-apis}) and sessions.
 * @param {Function} next - call `next()` to pass control to the next handler.
 */
function handler(context, next) {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Example

```js
const { middleware } = require('bottender');

...

const composedHandler = middleware([
  function handler1(context, next) { /* ... */ },
  function handler2(context, next) { /* ... */ },
  ...,
]);

bot.onEvent(composedHandlers);

...
```

Each event came from bot will be handled by function handler1.

Call `next()` in function handler1 and it will go to function handler2.
