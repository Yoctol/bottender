title: How to Run Bottender in Custom Server
---

## The Concept

The behavior of `bottender dev` and `bottender start` commands are start a default express server and load `index.js` from project root directory as the root action of the chatbot.

`bottender dev` and `bottender start` is the default command in the package.json generated by [create-bottender-app](getting-started#create-a-new-bottender-app) command

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bottender dev",
    "start": "bottender start",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

In order to run bottender in the custom http server, we need to run a http server, delegate the webhook routes to bottender, and modify the setting of package.json.

## Express

### Create New Project with Custom Express

If you want to have a clean project with custom express, you could start from [this example](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tree/master/examples/custom-server-express) to develop your project.

1. Download the code from [this example](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender/tree/master/examples/custom-server-express).
2. Run `yarn install` command to install dependencies.
3. Fill the `.env` file with correct value.
4. Run `yarn dev` to start server.

It's very simple.

Or you want to have the folder structure we recommanded, you could start with [create-bottender-app](getting-started#create-a-new-bottender-app) command and migrate to custom express server by follow the migration instructions below.

### Migrate Existing Project to Custom Express

Assume you have a project build from [create-bottender-app](getting-started#create-a-new-bottender-app) command and you want to have your custom express server. You need to write a custom express server and delegate all webhook request to bottender app.

1. Create a file `server.js` in the root directory of project.
2. Copy the following code into server.js

```javascript
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const express = require('express');
const { bottender } = require('bottender');

const app = bottender({
  dev: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
});

const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 5000;

// the request handler of the bottender app
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(() => {
  const server = express();

  server.use(
    bodyParser.json({
      verify: (req, _, buf) => {
        req.rawBody = buf.toString();
      },
    })
  );

  // your custom route
  server.get('/api', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ ok: true });
  });

  // route for webhook request
  server.all('*', (req, res) => {
    return handle(req, res);
  });

  server.listen(port, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(`> Ready on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
});
```

3. Modify the package.json like this.

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon server.js",
    "start": "node server.js",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

That's all you need to do.
