## Create a New Bottender App

Create Bottender App is the best way to start building a new application in Bottender.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest Bottender features, provides a great experience when developing on multiple channels, and optimizes your app for deploying to production. To create a project, run:

```sh
npx create-bottender-app my-app
```

> Note: `npx` comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [introduction blog post for npx command](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).

After you go through the interactive creation steps by steps, it will create a directory named `my-app` containing a fresh Bottender installation with all of Bottender's dependencies already installed:

The easiest way to test it is running the bot in ["Console Mode"](the-basics-console-mode.md). To do this, pass `--console` option to the command:

```sh
cd my-app
npm run dev -- --console
```

As you can see, we just got a bot that always replies "Welcome to Bottender" in the console.

## Teach Your Bot to Echo

What we did in the previous section is just a "Hello World" example. Let's see how it works and try to make some changes to it.

`src/index.js` is the entrypoint of the app created by Create Bottender App. There are only few lines of code in this file:

```js
module.exports = async function App(context) {
  await context.sendText('Welcome to Bottender');
};
```

It's very intuitive that it just sends back "Welcome to Bottender" whenever it is called.

The next step is teaching your bot to send back what it receives, so open the `src/index.js` file on the editor and apply following changes to the code:

```diff
module.exports = async function App(context) {
- await context.sendText('Welcome to Bottender');
+ if (context.event.isText) {
+   await context.sendText(context.event.text);
+ }
});
```

And the application will be restarted automatically.

That's it!
