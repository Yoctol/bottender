☝️By Bottender, you can easily begin your first Telegram Bot in 3 mins!!

## Enable Telegram Channel

### Create a New Telegram Bottender App

`Create Bottender App` is the best way to start building a new application in Bottender.

To create a project, run:

```sh
npx create-bottender-app my-app
```

Make sure that the `telegram` option is checked:

After finishing `Create Bottender App` process, `bottender.config.js`, a config file, will be generated automatically for furthur channel settings.

### Enable Telegram Channel for Existing Apps

First, you need to have a `bottender.config.js` file which sets `channels.telegram.enabled` as `true`:

```js
module.exports = {
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      path: '/webhooks/telegram',
      accessToken: process.env.TELEGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    },
  },
};
```

The default webhook path is `/webhooks/telegram`. You can set your own webhook path in the `path` field.

## Complete Telegram Channel Settings

To make Telegram bots work, you have to setup 2 values:

- Telegram Access Token
- Webhook

### Telegram Access Token

`bottender.config.js` looks up `.env` for Telegram access token, which could be generated by sending `/newbot` to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

> **Note:**
>
> - BotFather is a super elegant way to manage your bots. You don't need a developer accounts
> - See Telegram official doc, [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)).

Then, paste your Telegram bot token to the follwing field in `.env`.

```
TELEGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

### Webhook

<!-- Make seperated exaplataion for dev mode and in production with gif -->

After finishing above settings, you can start your server with Telegram webhook event listening using following commands:

```sh
# in production mode
npm start

# or in development mode
npm run dev
```

<!-- Leave an example of webhook -->

By the following command, you can finish the Telegram webhook setting.

```sh
npx bottender telegram webhook set
```

Now you are ready to interact with your bot on Telegram :)
