### Create a New Telegram Bottender App

Create Bottender App is the best way to start building a new application in Bottender.

To create a project, run:

```sh
npx create-bottender-app my-app
```

Make sure that the `telegram` option is checked:

After finishing `Create Bottender App` process, `bottender.config.js`, a config file, will be generated automatically for furthur channel settings.


### Enable Telegram Channel for Existing Apps


First, you need to have a `bottender.config.js` file which sets `channels.telegram.enabled` as `true`:

```js
module.exports = {
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      path: '/webhooks/telegram',
      accessToken: process.env.TELEGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    },
  },
};
```

The default webhook path is `/webhooks/telegram`, but you can set your own webhook path by `path` field. 


## Complete Telegram Channel Settings


To make Telegram bots work, you have to setup 2 values:
- Telegram Access Token
- Webhook

### Telegram Access Token

`bottender.config.js` looks up `.env` for Telegram access token, which could be generated by sending message to BotFather (see Telegram official document, [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)). Then, paste your Telegram bot token to the follwing field in `.env`.

```
TELEGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

### Webhook

After finsihing the above settings, you can start your server with Telegram webhook listening using following commands:

```
// in production mode
npm start

// or in development mode
npm run dev
```

By the following command, you can finish the Telegram webhook setting.

```
npx bottender telegram webhook set
```
