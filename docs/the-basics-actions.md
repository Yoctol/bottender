title: Resolving Actions
---

Actions are the smallest building blocks of Bottender apps. An action describes what you want to respond according to the conversation context.

To define an action, just write a JavaScript function or async function:

```js
async function SayHi(context) {
  await context.sendText('Hi!');
}
```

Actions typically accept `context` as first argument. There are a bunch of stuff in the conversation context, and you can use them to construct your actions. For instance, we can use `context.sendText` to send a text to the user from the bot.

## Composing Actions

// ...

For example, we can create an `App` action that says `Hi!` back when it receives `hi` and says sorry for anything else:

```js
async function SayHi(context) {
  await context.sendText('Hi!');
}

async function Unknown(context) {
  await context.sendText('Sorry. I do not understand what you say.');
}

async function App(context) {
  if (context.event.text == 'hi') {
    return SayHi;
  }
  return Unknown;
}
```

> Note: New Bottender apps created by Create Bottender App have a single `App` action as entrypoint in `src/index.js`. However, if you are very familiar with Bottender, you can rename the action or even use different structure instead.

## Passing Props to Actions

Previously, we only saw Bottender actions that accept one argument - `context`:

```js
async function SayHi(context) {
  await context.sendText('Hi!');
}
```

However, we can access the second argument - `props` to define actions with flexibility in mind:

```js
async function SayHi(context, props) {
  await context.sendText(`Hi, ${props.name}.`);
}
```

Instead of returning the action directly without `props`, we can use `withProps` to pass a single object as `props` to the action:

```js
const { withProps } = require('bottender');

async function App(context) {
  return withProps(SayHi, { name: 'Bob' });
}
```

Bottender will call the `SayHi` action with `{ name: 'Bob' }` as the `props` and send `Hi, Bob.` text message as result to the user.

## How to Debug

[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)

```sh
DEBUG=bottender:dialog npm start
```

<!--TODO:image-->

We recommend that always name your actions, so it will meaningful path to debug instead of Anonymous

> Note: If you are developing your bots on Windows, you can use [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) to assign `DEBUG` environment variable:

```sh
cross-env DEBUG=bottender:dialog npm start
```
